# ZTXP — Zero Trust eXchange Protocol

ZTXP defines a lightweight, vendor-neutral protocol for exchanging signed **Trust Assertion Messages (TAMs)** between Zero Trust components.  
Where TLS secures the transport, ZTXP secures the **meaning** — the who/what/why of trust.

## Specification
The current working draft is available at:
[spec/draft-ztxp-02.md](spec/draft-ztxp-02.md)

## Reference Implementation
